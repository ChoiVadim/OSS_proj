# Jarvis - Your Simple Voice Assistant
Jarvis is a simple voice assistant created as an experiment, combining the power of [Picovoice Porcupine Wake Word Detection](https://picovoice.ai/platform/porcupine/) & [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).. Whether you're a language learner, in need of information, want entertainment, or wish to control your smart home, Jarvis is here to assist you. Additionally, Jarvis can generate images and logos for you. And if you're feeling lonely, Jarvis is always ready for a chat! ðŸ˜„
